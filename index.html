    <p>"We, the representatives of the United Kingdom and United States, stand by our former conviction. The territory that is currently within our possession belongs to us: We have remained in possession of this territory for over 50 years. Therefore, we, alongside the governing authorities of our respective countries, find it unnecessary to hand this territory over to the Mauritians. Their claim to the lands is invalid. The islands are ours. They will stay that way. Any attempt to claim the territories of the Great Britain, as set forth by years of documentation, will be treated as grounds for warfare." - Sir Quinton Kingsley, 20XX, addressing the International Court of Justice</p>

  <p>The time has come. Mauritius, tired of the fruitlessness of their negotions, prepares to invade the British Indian Ocean Territories and claim them as their own. In preparation for the attack, British and US troops have been situated at Diego Garcia to respond. The time for negotiations has ended. The time for war is now.</p>
